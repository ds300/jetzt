# jetzt

*jetzt* is a speed-reader extension for [chrome](http://google.com/chrome) inspired by [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/).

### Installation

This is very much beta software so a proper chrome extension package is not currently provided. Instead: clone this repository, then, in chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions , enable developer mode, click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the directory you cloned.

Remember to pull every now and then for bugfixes and new features.


### Usage

Control is currently keyboard-only.

- Initiate jetzt by selecting some text and pressing `alt`-`s`.

- Change size with `+`/`-`.

- Go faster/slower with up/down arrow keys.

- Go back/forward a sentence with left/right arrow keys (hold `alt` to navigate by paragraphs).

- Pause with space.

- Close with escape.

### Feature Requests/Contributions

Feel free to open an issue for anything you would like to see in jetzt. 

I also welcome pull requests of all shapes and sizes. This project is still in heavy flux, though, so if you want to make a big change it might be best to open an issue to check that it's not already being worked on.
